      may be the happiest year for you. <br> May God bless
      your whole life and achieve your dream! I have <br>
      a message for you, and I am sure that you'll love it :</p>

        <p id="message">
          My friends, when January 1st comes, it means that <br>
          God has already given us a new year to live. <br>
          The LORD God loves us very much and made us <br>
          on his own image. You can't compare his love <br>
          to anything, He loves us more than our family, <br>
          friends... love us. In the morning, He only <br>
          wants us to say "good morning" to Him before <br>
          anyone else. And He also wants us to read the <br>
          Bible, which is His word, in the morning. <br>
          You MAY think that the Bible is so boring, <br>
          but actually NOT. The Bible tells many <br>
          beautiful stories, and especially in the <br>
          New Testament. In the New Testament, Jesus had <br>
          done many miracles (heal the little girl who is <br>
          years old, the woman who is in the 60s...). <br>
          Look how Jesus is so powerful, and His Father! <br>
          And by the way, you should FORGIVE and LOVE your <br>
          ENEMIES, like Jesus, so be like Him! If you are <br>
          worried to prevent sin, you can ask God and the <br>
          Holy Spirit to help you to sin LESS, but not be <br>
          a sinless person, because you are just a HUMAN <br>
          (only Jesus and Mary were sinless). My last advice <br>
          for you in this message is to go to Church every, <br>
          Sunday, because This is God's House, so it's so <br>
          important to go visit God in His House! <br>
          In summary, give your life to God. <br> <br>
          Thanks for reading this message so far, and Jesus <br>
          bless your new year! <br> <br>
